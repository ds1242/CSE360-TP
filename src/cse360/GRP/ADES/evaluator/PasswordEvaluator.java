* <p> Title: PasswordEvaluator Class - establishes the required data computations.

*
* <p> Description: This PasswordEvaluator class is strictly a computational class and 
* does not provide the user with a graphical user interface.
* 
* In this case the PasswordEvaluator deals with an input from the user and checks to see if it conforms to
* the requirements specified by a graphical representation of a finite state machine.
